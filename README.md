To know in the image that there is human or not a human i designed my own data set in which there are two classes, one of them contain human face
images and the other contains animal images first i generate the image data then plot the images then apply model code which take the input image 
i used the binary classifier i used rmsprop optimizer finaly i fit my model and get the accuracy and test it on my test data set.
